## EveHunt-API
This is an API for the app evehunt, it is used on the purpose of getting and sending data regarding events. You can check the api through https://stephenleo.pythonanywhere.com/swagger/

## Motivation
I saw a lot of people in my campus looking for events through my campus Line Square which ignited this idea of me creating an app for it.

## Build Status
- All of the main functionality has been implemented in this API.
- There are still other functionality that haven't been implemented yet like forgetting passwords, etc.
- No CI/CD has been implemented yet.
 Any help or contribution will be greatly appreciated.
